## [LetsGetChecked](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/letsgetchecked-health-testing/id1482260156)
`(Contract Work)`
<br>I've have the opportunity to contribute to this incredible iOS App. Using UIKit, I've helped refresh some of the designs, implement new health features, and help with bug fixes and design updates. 
This is ongoing work and just a few examples of the things I've had the opportunity to work on.

## [MyColar](https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/mycolar/id6587550067)
`ðŸ’» Available on the App Store`
<br>My most recent app, which I built and released on the App Store, was created out of personal need. I always prioritize simplicity, even for the most complex needs, and that's how MyColar was born. MyColar is a user-friendly app designed to streamline your clipboard history. It allows you to easily manage, access, and organize copied content with intuitive features. I wanted to challenge my design skills on this project and had fun adding some animations (all done with SwiftUI, of course!).

## [CityPortal](https://github.com/joseasync/CityPortal) 
[ðŸ‘“ Sneak peek](https://youtu.be/DmVxXlbJAnA)
<br>This project was created to practice my knowledge with RealityKit using my Apple Vision Pro. City Portal is an AR application developed with SwiftUI and RealityKit. It allows users to explore different virtual worlds through portals in a 3D environment. Each world is shown as a skybox, and users can interact by dragging a 3D box within the scene. This project helped me to improve my skills and learn more about working with augmented reality.
